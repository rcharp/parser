> Hi,
> You have used 80% of your 1000 free dyno hours for June 2018. The following steps can help you keep your app running smoothly.
> Upgrade to more powerful dynos As your app grows, upgrade to Hobby dynos for $7 per dyno per month. Your app will never sleep and users will get 24/7 access. In addition, you’ll get free SSL & Automated Certificate Management for custom domains, Application Metrics, and multiple workers for more powerful apps.
> Optimize your monitoring services A monitoring service could be keeping your app awake unintentionally. Run heroku logs to view your app's logs. If needed, remove Pingdom, New Relic, or other availability monitoring services that are not required.
> Check your app for worker dynos Your app may not be running a web dyno. Once worker-only apps are started, they run continuously. You can avoid this by upgrading to Hobby dynos or running heroku ps:stop <process-type> on your app. 
> Dyno sleeping lets us provide you and millions of other users with a free tier for experimenting, hacking on personal projects, and running low traffic apps.
> If you have questions, please visit help.heroku.com <http://help.heroku.com/>.
> Happy coding,
> Heroku
